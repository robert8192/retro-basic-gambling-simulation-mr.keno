# retro-basic-gambling-simulation-mr.keno
Simulates Keno with selecting numbers and having computer pick 20 numbers and reports winnings .. losses SEE WUZZLE repository for Prerequesesits..
This is a great hodge-podge of code
It begins in 1971, Yeah.. the year they invented circles.
So, I have decided to do a YT-video explaining the code.

To compile->
1.>  run toyE_Editor.
2.> PRESS F-2
3.>  in directory -rename '02 -  Mr keno' file  -->'keno.txt'
3. Type 'keno.txt'  PRESS ENTER
4. PRESS F-12 TO COMPILE
5. OUTPUT --> 'filename4.prg'
6. run by double-click WUZZLE.exe

There is a problem with the above.. steps
As there will already be a 'filename4.prg'.. you must
rename it  to something else.. prior to running toeE_editor..
